This sample demonstrates how to bring an existing project to Teams Toolkit v5.0.

It is based on the [Teams Conversation Bot SSO quick-start](https://adoption.microsoft.com/en-us/sample-solution-gallery/sample/officedev-microsoft-teams-samples-bot-conversation-sso-quickstart-js/) sample.

## Teams Toolkit v5.0 Pre-release

### What does pre-release mean?
Pre-release is meant for those who are eager to try the latest Teams Toolkit features and fixes. Even though pre-releases are not intended for use in production, they are at a sufficient quality level for you to generally use and [provide feedback](https://aka.ms/ttk-feedback). However, pre-release versions can and probably will change, and those changes could be major.

We've addressed a number of reported bugs and added major changes in this release based on your feedback to make Teams Toolkit more flexible. Some of the key highlights to these changes include:

- Use existing infrastructure, resource groups, and more when provisioning
- Use an existing Teams app ID
- Use an existing Azure AD app registration ID
- Use a different tunneling solution or customize the defaults
- Add custom steps to debugging, provisioning, deploying, publishing, etc.

### What about my existing Teams Toolkit projects?
The changes in this pre-release require upgrades to the TeamsFx configuration files. We recommend that you create a new app using this version. In the future, we'll provide a way to automatically upgrade existing Teams apps that were created with a previous version of Teams Toolkit.
